# Getting Started with Obsidian

Obsidian is a knowledge management tool that works on local markdown files.

## Core Concepts

1. **Vault** — a folder of markdown files
2. **Links** — connect notes with `[[wikilinks]]`
3. **Graph** — visualize connections between notes
4. **Plugins** — extend functionality

## First Steps

- Create a daily note: [[Templates/daily-note]]
- Start a project: [[Templates/project-note]]
- Learn about [[Notes/Zettelkasten-method|Zettelkasten]]

## Tips

Use tags sparingly. Prefer links over tags for discoverability. Properties (frontmatter) are better for structured metadata.

See [[References/Keyboard-shortcuts]] for navigation.
