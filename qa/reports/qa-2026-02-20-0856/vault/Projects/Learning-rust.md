# Learning Rust

Working through the Rust book and building small projects to learn systems programming.

## Resources

- The Rust Programming Language (official book)
- Rustlings exercises
- Advent of Code problems

## Progress

- [x] Chapters 1-4: basics, ownership, borrowing
- [x] Chapters 5-8: structs, enums, collections
- [ ] Chapters 9-12: error handling, generics, testing
- [ ] Chapters 13-16: closures, iterators, concurrency
- [ ] Build a CLI tool as capstone project

## Notes

The ownership model is the hardest part. Think of it like [[Notes/Zettelkasten-method|Zettelkasten]] — each value has exactly one owner, just like each idea belongs to one note.
