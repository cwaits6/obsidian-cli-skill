# Zettelkasten Method

A note-taking system developed by Niklas Luhmann. The key principle: each note should contain one atomic idea and link to related ideas.

## Principles

- **Atomicity** — one idea per note
- **Connectivity** — link liberally between notes
- **Emergence** — structure emerges from connections, not folders

## In Practice

1. Capture fleeting thoughts in [[Inbox/Quick-thought|Inbox]]
2. Process into permanent notes in Notes/
3. Link to existing ideas
4. Review connections in the graph view
