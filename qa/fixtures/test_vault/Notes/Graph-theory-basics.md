# Graph Theory Basics

Graphs model pairwise relationships between objects. In a knowledge vault, notes are nodes and links are edges.

## Key Terms

- **Node** — a point (a note)
- **Edge** — a connection (a link)
- **Degree** — number of connections a node has
- **Path** — sequence of edges connecting two nodes
- **Cluster** — group of densely connected nodes

## Why It Matters for PKM

Your vault's graph view is literally a graph. Notes with high degree (many links) are hub concepts. Orphan notes have degree zero — they're disconnected from your knowledge network.
