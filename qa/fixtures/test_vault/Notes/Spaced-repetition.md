# Spaced Repetition

A learning technique where review intervals increase over time. Based on the forgetting curve research by Ebbinghaus.

## How It Works

- Review new material after 1 day
- Then after 3 days
- Then after 7 days
- Then after 14 days
- Then after 30 days

## Tools

- Anki (dedicated SRS app)
- Obsidian Spaced Repetition plugin
- Manual review with daily notes

## Connection to PKM

Spaced repetition works well with [[Notes/Zettelkasten-method|Zettelkasten]] — revisiting linked notes naturally reinforces memory.
