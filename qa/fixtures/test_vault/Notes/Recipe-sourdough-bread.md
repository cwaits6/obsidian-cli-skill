# Sourdough Bread Recipe

## Ingredients

- 500g bread flour
- 350g water (70% hydration)
- 100g active starter
- 10g salt

## Method

1. Mix flour and water, autolyse 30 min
2. Add starter and salt, fold to combine
3. Bulk ferment 4-6 hours with stretch-and-folds every 30 min
4. Shape and cold retard 12-16 hours
5. Bake at 500F in Dutch oven: 20 min covered, 20 min uncovered

## Notes

- Higher hydration = more open crumb but harder to handle
- Starter should pass the float test before using
- Ambient temperature affects fermentation time dramatically
