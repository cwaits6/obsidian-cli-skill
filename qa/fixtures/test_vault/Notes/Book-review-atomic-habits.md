# Book Review: Atomic Habits

By James Clear. Core thesis: tiny changes compound into remarkable results.

## Key Ideas

1. **1% better every day** — small improvements accumulate
2. **Systems over goals** — focus on process, not outcome
3. **Identity-based habits** — become the type of person who does X
4. **Habit stacking** — attach new habits to existing ones

## Favorite Quotes

> "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems."

> "Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become."

## Application

Could apply habit stacking to my note-taking practice:
- After morning coffee → write daily note
- After each meeting → process meeting notes into action items
