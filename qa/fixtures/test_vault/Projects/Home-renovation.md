# Home Renovation

Kitchen and bathroom updates planned for spring.

## Budget

| Item | Estimate |
|------|----------|
| Kitchen counters | $3,500 |
| Backsplash tile | $800 |
| Bathroom vanity | $1,200 |
| Labor | $4,000 |
| **Total** | **$9,500** |

## Tasks

- [ ] Get 3 contractor quotes
- [ ] Choose countertop material
- [ ] Order tile samples
- [ ] Schedule plumber for bathroom

## Notes

Prefer quartz over granite for counters — lower maintenance. Check if the HOA needs to approve exterior-visible changes.
