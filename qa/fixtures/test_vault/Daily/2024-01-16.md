# 2024-01-16

## Morning

- Process inbox: [[Inbox/Quick-thought]], [[Inbox/Article-to-read]]
- Continue Rust chapters — [[Projects/Learning-rust]]

## Tasks

- [x] Process 2 inbox notes
- [ ] Read Rust chapter 9 (error handling)
- [x] Order tile samples for [[Projects/Home-renovation|renovation]]

## Notes

- Interesting connection between [[Notes/Zettelkasten-method|Zettelkasten]] atomicity and Rust's ownership model — one owner per value, one idea per note
- Started [[Notes/Book-review-atomic-habits|Atomic Habits]] — the 1% improvement idea applies to note-taking habits too

## End of Day

**What went well:** Made progress on inbox, found a cool cross-domain connection.

**What to improve:** Rust chapter got pushed again. Block time for it tomorrow.
