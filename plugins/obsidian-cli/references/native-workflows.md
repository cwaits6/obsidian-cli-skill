# Native Obsidian Workflows

When the CLI cannot accomplish a task, detailed native Obsidian instructions will be provided. This reference exists as a reminder that native workflows are available as fallbacks.

Common fallback scenarios:
- Complex Base configuration (better done in Obsidian UI)
- Interactive template testing before automation
- Advanced property validation or bulk edits with complex rules

When you encounter a task the CLI can't handle, ask for detailed native Obsidian instructions and I'll provide step-by-step guidance.
